# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## my project in a few words: 
I have started to build a blog with the laravel framework two months ago to increase my php skills, but in the last few weeks I dind't really continue coding anymore so a friend of mine told me to join this challenge as a motivation and continue the project! So here is my progress:

### Day 1: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I built the tag model for the app and created the migration.

**Thoughts:** Learning about relational databases is kind of confusing if you do it for the first time, but it is fun if Isee its finally working and the things play well together.

**Link to work:** coming soon..
